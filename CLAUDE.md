# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in this repository.

## Architecture

**Branch structure:**
- `master` - core infrastructure only
- `bindings` - merges master + adds API bindings

**Directory structure (master):**
- `crates/` - core infrastructure (`concord-core`, `concord-http`, `concord-codegen`)
- `schemas/` - OpenAPI specs (fetched, not generated code)

**Directory structure (bindings branch adds):**
- `bindings/` - API bindings (`web-*`, `openapi-*`, `ffi-*`)

**Binding categories:**
- `web-*`: Browser/Web API bindings
- `openapi-*`: Generated from OpenAPI schemas
- `ffi-*`: Foreign function interface bindings

**OpenAPI workflow:** Schemas stored in `schemas/<api-name>/`. Generation via `cargo run -p rhi-concord-codegen`. Generated code is a build artifact, not checked into git.

**Multi-language:** Codegen targets multiple languages (Rust, TypeScript, Python, etc.). Consumers use native bindings without needing Rust/cargo. Schemas are the universal source of truth.

## Core Rule

**Note things down immediately:**
- Bugs/issues → fix or add to TODO.md
- Design decisions → docs/ or code comments
- Future work → TODO.md
- Key insights → this file

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**Don't say these (edit first):** "Fair point", "Should have", "That should go in X" → edit the file BEFORE responding.

**Conversation is not memory.** Anything said in chat evaporates at session end. If it implies future behavior change, write it to CLAUDE.md or a memory file immediately — or it will not happen.

**Warning — these phrases mean something needs to be written down right now:**
- "I won't do X again" / "I'll remember to..." / "I've learned that..."
- "Next time I'll..." / "From now on I'll..."
- Any acknowledgement of a recurring error without a corresponding CLAUDE.md or memory edit

**When the user corrects you:** Ask what rule would have prevented this, and write it before proceeding. **"The rule exists, I just didn't follow it" is never the diagnosis** — a rule that doesn't prevent the failure it describes is incomplete; fix the rule, not your behavior.

**Corrections are documentation lag, not model failure.** When the same mistake recurs, the fix is writing the invariant down — not repeating the correction. Every correction that doesn't produce a CLAUDE.md edit will happen again. Exception: during active design, corrections are the work itself — don't prematurely document a design that hasn't settled yet.

**Something unexpected is a signal, not noise.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, files containing what they shouldn't — stop and ask why before continuing. Don't accept anomalies and move on.

**Do the work properly.** When asked to analyze X, actually read X - don't synthesize from conversation.

**If citing CLAUDE.md after failing:** The file failed its purpose. Adjust it to actually prevent the failure.

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this crate/module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps, incomplete pagination, or unexposed trait methods
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**Always commit completed work.** After tests pass, commit immediately — don't wait to be asked. When a plan has multiple phases, commit after each phase passes. Do not accumulate changes across phases. Uncommitted work is lost work.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Context Management

**Use subagents to protect the main context window.** For broad exploration or mechanical multi-file work, delegate to an Explore or general-purpose subagent rather than running searches inline. The subagent returns a distilled summary; raw tool output stays out of the main context.

Rules of thumb:
- Research tasks (investigating a question, surveying patterns) → subagent; don't pollute main context with exploratory noise
- Searching >5 files or running >3 rounds of grep/read → use a subagent
- Codebase-wide analysis (architecture, patterns, cross-file survey) → always subagent
- Mechanical work across many files (applying the same change everywhere) → parallel subagents
- Single targeted lookup (one file, one symbol) → inline is fine

## Session Handoff

Use plan mode as a handoff mechanism when:
- A task is fully complete (committed, pushed, docs updated)
- The session has drifted from its original purpose
- Context has accumulated enough that a fresh start would help

**For handoffs:** enter plan mode, write a short plan pointing at TODO.md, and ExitPlanMode. **Do NOT investigate first** — the session is context-heavy and about to be discarded. The fresh session investigates after approval.

**For mid-session planning** on a different topic: investigating inside plan mode is fine — context isn't being thrown away.

**Initiate a handoff after a significant mid-session correction.** When a correction happens after substantial wrong-path work, the wrong reasoning is still in context and keeps pulling. Writing down the invariant and starting fresh beats continuing with poisoned context — the next session loads the invariant from turn 1 before any wrong reasoning exists.

Before the handoff plan, update TODO.md and memory files with anything worth preserving.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead
- Create special cases - design to avoid them
- Create legacy APIs - one API, update all callers
- Do half measures - migrate ALL callers when adding abstraction
- Ask permission when philosophy is clear - just do it
- Return tuples - use structs with named fields
- Use trait default implementations - explicit impl required
- Replace content when editing lists - extend, don't replace
- Cut corners with fallbacks - implement properly for each case
- Mark as done prematurely - note what remains
- Fear "over-modularization" - 100 lines is fine for a module
- Consider time constraints - optimize for correctness
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment

## Design Principles

**Backend agnostic:** Bindings should work with any async runtime (tokio, async-std, smol) and HTTP client. Use traits for abstraction. Feature flags for optional backends.

**Edition 2024:** Use Rust edition 2024 features. Embrace new patterns (e.g., async closures, gen blocks where applicable).

**Type safety over convenience:** Prefer strongly-typed APIs. Use newtypes for IDs, enums for finite sets. Avoid stringly-typed interfaces.

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** HashMap > inventory crate. OnceLock > lazy_static. Functions > traits until you need the trait.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

**When stuck (2+ attempts):** Step back. Am I solving the right problem?
